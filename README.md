The original java code (JavaSE-1.8) was constructed in Eclipse Java Neon.3.  The root directory can be imported into a new project.

The subdirectory "playframework" was created in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2018.2.5 for the web interface
	REQUIREMENTS:
	- SBT-1.2.6.MSI (https://www.scala-sbt.org/download.html)
	- Gradle 4.10.2 (https://gradle.org/install/)
	- Ensure "paths" are properly updated

To run the web aplpication, to go the strataHealthProject/playframework directory in a command prompt and use "sbt run"
Once the server is online, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:9000/
The web interface should work, the rest should be self explainatory

Rationale for using the play framework:
I have never used a java framework before, I have only been trained to use Java Applets.
From my research, it seemed that "play" was beginner friendly, so I taught myself how to use it.
